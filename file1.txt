Hello everyone!
My name is Shreeraj Bhamare.
I am 20 years old.

I study in coep.
I am pursuing my BTech in Computer Engineering.
I love to go on trips and explore places.
Oh! And I love to dance and listen to music.
It makes me happy.
This college offers me a lot of opportunities.

We have DSA in our fourth semester.
I have taken diffpatch as my project.
It is very interesting.
Learning new things is always fun.
